## 🙏 TESTIMONY

This lineage began with a prayer for a small guardian dog. Two weeks later, God answered in the middle of a street. Rocky survived parvo in a two-day battle and became the founder of this bloodline. Through Rocky and Artemis, then Pearl, the line continues through the Stillness Litter (F2.2).

We do not breed dogs. We guard bloodlines.
